    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank"> "javascript</a> is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.[6] Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]

Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.
 These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps.
 <br>
 The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.[11]

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-timeâ€“compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[12] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
